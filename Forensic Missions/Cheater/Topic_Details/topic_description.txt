Forensic 2


From: howard.davis@divorceattorneys.rus

My client is being accused of cheating on his wife. A photograph has been presented in court that shows him with another woman in their bedroom, in their home. The woman in question is a known friend to them both. My client has stated that he did take the photo. However, he claims it was a "selfie" and no other person was present in the home or in the picture.

As the forensic specialist for our law firm, are you able to detect any digital manipulation within this image?
