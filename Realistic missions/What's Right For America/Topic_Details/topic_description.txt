Message: Friend of freedom and liberty, I invite you to take a look at the hate speech being spewed over the web at http://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/7/. It's so funny that conservatives keep saying they want to protect the values of America - freedom, tolerance, and democracy - but when it comes to personal choices like private marijuana use or same-sex marriages, they damn them to burn in eternal hell and send them to jail.
This is a personal freedom issue. No one else is hurt if two consenting adults decide to marry. But people who claim to have the moral high ground decide to ruin it for everyone else and discriminate against same-sex couples. To think that they are talking about making a constitutional amendment to STOP OUR FREEDOM TO MARRY is ludicrous. This injustice must be stopped.
There is an admin section on that website somewhere, perhaps hidden among their directory structure. It would be a great fight against moral tyranny and a victory for freedom if you could somehow hack into their website. Thank you.
