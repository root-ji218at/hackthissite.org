Message: Hello, I was referred to you by a friend who says you know how to hack into computers and web sites - well I was wondering if you could help me out here. There's this local store who is killing hundreds of animals a day exclusively for the purpose of selling jackets and purses etc out of their skin! I have been to their website and they have an email list for their customers. I was wondering if you could somehow hack in and send me every email address on that list? I want to send them a message letting them know of the murder they are wearing. Just reply to this message with a list of the email addresses. Please? Their website is at http://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/4/. Thanks so much!!
